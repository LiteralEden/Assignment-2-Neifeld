		<h2>Step 3 Paragraph</h2>
			<p>	The top 2 strengths of the system were the Boolean operators option and ability to search for words within specific issues. The Boolean operators are useful to find specific articles containing words or combinations of words while excluding others.</p> <img src="boolean search result.png" alt="A Boolean search" width=50% height=50% > <p>Once someone finds an article that looks promising, they can then drill down further by searching for keywords individually within the issue with the search document bar, instead of skimming by eye. </p> <img src="document search result.png" alt="Document Search Results"width=30% height=30%> <p>This is especially useful because some of the older issues are damaged and a little hard to read or skim by eye alone. The top 2 weaknesses were keyword search and redundant filters. Keyword searches seem a little limited; I experimented with a few words, but when searching for the word “for”, a word that should be in basically every edition of the newspaper, it only revealed 238 results.</p><img src="JSTOR for search results.png" alt="JSTOR For Search Results"width=30% height=30%> <p>There are no suggestions about what I could do to get more results, only options to refine and filter my search for fewer. I did check out JSTOR’s help documentation, which is a good thing to have in accordance with Nielsen’s heuristics, but could not resolve my issue. Another downside of the system is that many of the filters result in no change due to the option being redundant. For example, the tower archives are all in English, I can access them online, and they are all a serial, so selecting the “English”, “serial”, and “Content I can access” options does nothing. The amount of items was at 2262 before and remains at 2262 after. </p><img src="jstor content type search results.png" alt="JSTOR Content Type Search Results" width =20% height=20%> 
<p>	Overall my heuristic review mostly ran into trouble with the keyword search issue– it was a little troublesome to search “war” and received no results when I was trying to find out about campus attitudes towards armed conflict. I eventually found an editorial about the just war as a philosophical and theoretical concept by trying to search by date, but I question why it did not show up in keyword search, given that war was in the title.

		<h2>Step 3 Nielsen Heuristic Review</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Visibility of system status. This principle was minimally followed by JSTOR; there wasn’t much load time so I did not see a loading bar or icon. The icon in the tab did change to a loading icon, but that may be specific to my browser.
</li>
				<li>Match between system and the real world. The language in JSTOR did not have any jargon or industry-specific terms I didn’t understand, so this went well.</li>
				<li>User control and freedom. There is a “back to results” button and top bar showing stages of the search so the user can click back at any time, so this principle was well done.</li>
				<li>Consistency and standards. I did not see any tutorial except for on the separate help page. When I had an issue with keyword search, I couldn’t see anything to help me figure out what was wrong, so this principle was not really followed.
</li>
				<li>Error prevention. There was no suggestion of misspelling when I inputted a misspelled word, or suggestions on how to correct it, so JSTOR does not do well on this metric. 
</li>
				<li>Recognition rather than recall. JSTOR did well here– All the actions and the path the system took were made visible so I could find them again.
</li>
				<li>Flexibility and efficiency of use. This was a principle I had some trouble evaluating, as I was not an advanced JSTOR user and thus did not know any shortcuts I could test.
</li>
				<li>Aesthetic and minimalist design. JSTOR adhered well to this principle in general, but as noted in my complaint above, most of the filter categories for the Tower were of categories it already fit, like English-language, serial, available incline, etc. So those were redundant and did not need to be displayed.</li>
				<li>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. I did not encounter any error messages from JSTOR, even when I had trouble with my keyword search. I can’t evaluate how helpful the error messages are because I didn’t see them, but their absence means this principle was not followed very well.</li>
				<li>Help and documentation. JSTOR does have a help page with many examples of problems and troubleshooting, as well as FAQs. I could not resolve my issue by going there, so some credit docked for that, but it was comprehensive otherwise.</li>
			</ol>
		<h2>Step 5 Paragraph</h2>
			<p>Overall, there were some similarities between the heuristic review and the mini-usability test. My participant and I seemed to run into the same issues with keyword search in particular not being very effective; they elected to skim the thumbnail preview of the front page instead, but I don’t think that’s very efficient, as well as being hard on the eyes. Perhaps instead a list of tags could be added to the item details section of an issue, with the option to search by tags in JSTOR’s search. I realize this would be very labor-intensive, so perhaps AI could help. What the tags should focus on would have to be determined early on to avoid scope creep as well. Both the heuristic review and mini-usability test ran into issues finding something relevant in time as well. In my heuristic review I tried to find information about armed conflict but didn’t get very far, with the closest being an editorial on just war theory as a matter of theology, and the mini-usability test participant only found one example for World War II and the Vietnam War each, instead of two. Improving the keyword search would also cut down on time. 
A notable difference was that my participant didn’t realize there was a search document bar available to find words within the issue, while I did. It is possible that my participant was distracted or simply prefers to skim things visually, but I wonder if this feature could be more prominently advertised. Most of the issues are in black and white, so having the search document bar be in color would create color contrast and draw the eye to it. For accessibility reasons it would have to be a high-contrast color from the black background, so perhaps a highlighter yellow border.
